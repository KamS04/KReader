Once at the home screen, click on ***MangaDex*** then either use the search box to search for manga, or use the select button to put in the url for a manga.
The app is a bit slow, but it's only meant to be a temporary fix until mangadex comes back.

The ***CBZ*** source can open images inside ```.zip``` or ```.cbz``` files.
